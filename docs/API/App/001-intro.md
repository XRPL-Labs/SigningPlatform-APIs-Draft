# `INTRO` App API

The XRPL Labs "Signing Client" (App) allows consumers and small business to check their XRP account(s) balances and transactions in the native asset (XRP) and IOU's. The App allows users to securely sign transactions in a convenient way. 

The App features an opt-in platform allowing 3rd party developers and users to connect, send & sign "sign requests" and handle payment requests. Using anonymous "dictionary services" users can also find contacts to send payments or payment requests. 

The "IOU dictionary" allows users to easily add trust lines, hold and manage non-XRP currencies, and easily convert between on-ledger currencies.
