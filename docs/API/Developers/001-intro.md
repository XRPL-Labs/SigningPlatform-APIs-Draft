# `INTRO` Public API

## Audience / purpose

Developers that want to integrate the XRPL Labs Signing Platform into their own application can use the (this) Public API. 

The Public API allows developers to send a pre-composed transaction to the Signing Platform. App users can then review and reject, or review and sign the pre-composed transaction. A callback (webhook) will be sent to the developer platform.
