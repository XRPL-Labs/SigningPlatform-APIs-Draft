# `INTRO` Simple API

## Audience

Developers, sending **server to server** HTTPS POST requests to the API with their developer credentials. 

## Purpose

Allow users to sign transactions by posting a to-sign transaction to the platform, getting a redirect-URL from the platform to redirect the user to. Optionally the user can allow the App to send PUSH sign-requests in the future, thus sending a personal user-push token to the app for the next request.
